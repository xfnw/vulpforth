how are strings handled?
	strings are pairs of a pointer to the first character and the length.
	however, strings created by the " word are additionally null terminated,
	and some words that interface with linux syscalls that expect null
	terminated strings (like open) will write a null byte after the length,
	so be careful when passing slices of longer strings around.

vulpforth's weird behaviors

this is a list of bugs that will not be fixed. if you found a bug not
listed here, please report it: https://github.com/xfnw/vulpforth/issues

the number parser has no input validation
	this will cause various unexpected results, 0h $h are parsed as
	the number 1, and the word not found logic will never run for
	words starting with a number or $ since they count as numbers

the ok prompt is not emitted for some edge cases
	since vulpforth is not line buffered, repl determines whether
	it should emit an ok by checking that the whitespace at the
	end of the last word consumed by the word word is not a literal
	space. this heuristic breaks when a word that consumes stdin
	without using the word word is used at the end of a line, or
	when a line has a trailing space.
